# ABSTRACT: 

Choral conducting is a meeting among the music, the conductor, and the
performers. But, what are the responsibilities of the conductors? Mainly,
they should help the choir to keep the rhythm, transmit them the nuances of
the play, and make all the elements of the score consistent. The non-verbal
language of a choir director is a fundamental part of any choir performance
and is highly reinforced in music conservatories. However, one of the main
problems that conductors face is the dificulty in their practice since they do
not have at their disposal a real choir or an expert in providing them with
useful feedback.
This project aims to make use of a gamified virtual reality and gesture
capture to over choir conductors with a safe and useful place to practice and
improve. Thus, we intend to overcome the lack of means by offering the user
a gamified tool divided into initial tutorials and more challenging levels. We
aim to over an experience as close as possible to a real choir. In this way, the
student (future conductor) can control aspects such as tempo, volume, and
tone with his hands, and can also select the voice that should start singing.
Those aspects make our tool an efective way to practice choir conducting
before facing real choirs.
In this paper, we present the design and developing phases of the project.
Even though we do not have a fully playtesting yet, experts' opinions agree
on the usefulness of the project as a complementary tool for the future choir
direction students, providing a highly accurate and realistic space to practice
the needed abilities.

# INSTALLATION ADVICES: 

## STEAM: 
  - In order to run ChoVR it is necesary to have installed SteamVR. 
  - It can be installed from https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/ 
  
## CALIBRATION: 
  - Before run ChoVR it is highly recommended to calibrate HI5 Gloves using the Noitom's calibration scene provided in this repo with the name "calibration HI5 Gloves". 

## SOUND:
  - When SteamVR is initiated the sound output of your computer is changed to VIVE Headset output. To change this it is necessary to change output it Control Panel -> sound -> output device to PC's output. 
## HEADSET ERROR: 
  - Sometimes it is possible that an error message appears from the SteamVR headset, this occurs because in the position in which the headset is located is not communicating properly with the base stations. To fix this error is necessary to restart steamVR.
